## Architecture

For this app, I chose to use the MVVM architecture, which provides a simpler and more straightforward way to separate concerns, and followed the SOLID principles to ensure maintainability, scalability, and testability. Since the app only has two activities, the added complexity of Clean Architecture or multi-modular approach may not be necessary. By combining the MVVM architecture and SOLID principles, I was able to create a well-organized and maintainable app that is easy to test and extend.

### Communication between layers

1. The UI layer observes changes in the ViewModel and displays the data accordingly.
2. The ViewModel retrieves data from the Repository and updates the LiveData object.
3. The Repository retrieves data from a Remote Data Source.

### Components

* Presentation Layer: Consists of Activities/Fragments and their corresponding XML layout files.
* ViewModel: Holds the UI-related data and provides data to the View Layer via LiveData.
* Repository: Provides an abstraction layer between the Data layer and the ViewModel.
* Data Layer: Consists of a Remote Data Source that provides data to the Repository.

The App is not organized into multiple modules but follows the same principles of the Model View View-Model pattern.

1. The presentation layer handles the UI work with the logic contained in the **ViewModel**.
2. The UI uses a **LiveData** object from the ViewModel and observes it using the **Observer Pattern**.
3. A ListAdapter handles the actual displaying of the orders. Data over the network is retrieved using
   **retrofit** and **coroutines** to handle background work asynchronously. Additionally, note that
   the ViewModel uses the **viewModelScope** to launch the coroutines while Fragments use the **viewLifeCycleOwner**
   to observe data.
4. The data layer uses the recommended **Repository Pattern** to make the network calls providing an abstraction layer between the ViewModel and the Remote Data Source.

## Flow

**Deliveries screen**

Once the app is launched, the user has the option of choosing a delivery order to fulfill.

**Delivery details Screen**

This screen is accessible from the Deliveries screen to allow driver to see the order details.

**Pause trip screen**

This screen is accessible from the Deliveries screen to allow driver to pause a trip.
