## Architecture

### Implemented using Clean Architecture
The following diagram shows the structure of this project with 3 layers:
- Presentation
- Domain
- Data

</p>
<br>

### Communication between layers

1. UI calls method from ViewModel.
2. ViewModel executes Use case.
3. Each Repository returns data from a Data Source (Remote).
4. Information flows back to the UI where we display the Deliveries.



The App is not organized into multiple modules but follows the same principles of
the Presentation, Domain, and Data Layers.
The presentation layer handles the UI work with the logic contained in the **ViewModel**.
The UI uses a **LiveData** object from the ViewModel and observes it using the **Observer Pattern**.
A ListAdapter handles the actual displaying of the news. Data over the network is retrieved using
**retrofit** and **coroutines** to handle background work asynchronously. Additionally, note that
the ViewModel uses the **viewModelScope** to launch the coroutines while Fragments use the **viewLifeCycleOwner**
to observe data.
The data layer uses the recommended **Repository Pattern** to make the network calls.


## Flow

**Deliveries screen**

Once the app is launched, the user has the option of choosing a delivery order to fulfill.

**Delivery Details Screen**

This screen is accessible from the Deliveries screen to allow Driver to see the order details.


**Pause Trip Screen**

This screen is accessible from the Deliveries screen to allow Driver to Pause a Trip.
